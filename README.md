<b>GMM</b> : Gaussian Mixture Models
 - A clustering algorithm that groups data based on their similarity. Below are pictures of the GMM algorithm being applied to an image of a flower. The GMM in this instance was tasked in finding 3 clusters for the data and cluster centers were picked at random from the dataset.
